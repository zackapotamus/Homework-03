# Password Generator

## Description

This web application will generate randome passwords based on the options chosen by the user.

High quality random passwords are harder for brute force methods to crack, so having a long, random password utilizing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters will better protect you the event that your password hash is exfiltrated by hackers.

The options for the generated password are gathered through the use of `confirmation`s and `prompt`s. The underlying logic will ensure valid answers are given such that a valid password can be made. It then displays the password on the page.

This was a fun coding problem :)
